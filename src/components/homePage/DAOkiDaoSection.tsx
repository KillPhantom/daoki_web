          To avoid the tragedy of commons happening in a lot of other DAOs, we
          do not have a treasury/common resources owned by the whole community.
          Everyone is responsible for their own information/knowledge entry in
          DAOki. Thus, we can enable the best utilization of resources and a
          cultivated environment for collaboration and competition.

          With the help of Donors and the contribution of the seed team, DAOki

          All code of DAOki will be publicly available. Any suggestions will be
